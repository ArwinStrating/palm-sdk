## Overview

Palm SDK provides functions and tools to be able to easily query developer data from the data warehouse.


## Installation

The Palm SDK is available on npm as `@strating/palm-sdk`. (Note that this is a private package and you will therefore need access to the npm registry):

```bash
$ npm install --save @strating/palm-sdk
```

To use the module in your application, `require` it from any JavaScript file:

```js
var palm = require("@strating/palm-sdk");
```

If you are using ES2015, you can `import` the module instead:

```js
import * as palm from "@strating/palm-sdk";
```
